                 *** Upcoming WRDS Maintenance Announcement ***

      The WRDS servers will be undergoing regularly scheduled

      maintenance from 8:00am - 11:00am ET on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.
      This will affect the WRDS Cloud system and PC-SAS access. We will
      be patching the systems to provide the most up-to-date
      computing environment for your research programming needs.

      You will not be able to access the servers while the
      maintenance is in progress. WRDS Cloud jobs WILL BE
      TERMINATED, and access to the WRDS Cloud head nodes
      will be disabled for the duration of the maintenance window.
      PC-SAS/CONNECT sessions and WRDS SAS/STUDIO sessions will be
      interrupted, and will need to be restarted following the
      completion of the maintenance window.

      Please contact wrds-support@wharton.upenn.edu if you have any
      questions or concerns. Thank you.
